# Overview
In recent years, authorship analysis of anonymous texts in the Internets has received some attention 
in cyber forensic and data mining communities. Authorship analysis is the study of linguistic and 
computational characteristics of the documents written by known or unknown authors.
The problem is determining the true author of texts was a task of social interest from the moment 
it was possible to attribute the authorship of words. With the development of statistical techniques 
and due to the wide availability of data that can be accessed from the internet, authorship analysis 
has become a very practical option.
The aim of this project is to predict the author of given sentence, the key idea is to exploit the 
differences of the writing styles of the authors and use this information to build our models. We 
will try many experiments in our project using varies machine learning models and a pre-trained 
language model and we will focus on some performance measure metrics to evaluate the models
such as: Precision, Recall, F1-score and we will see the accuracy confusion matrix. To accomplish 
the project we will follow the following Natural Language Processing pipeline:

# Data Description
The dataset obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-authoridentification/data, it contains text from works of fiction written by spooky authors of the public 
domain: Edgar Allan Poe, HP Lovecraft and Mary Shelley
| **Feature** | **Description** |**DataType** |
|:------|:-------|:-------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier for each sentence   |object   |
| **Text** |  Some text written by one of the authors object|object   |
| **Author** |  Author of the sentence in a shortcut format (EAP: Edgar Allan Poe, HPL: HP Lovecraft, MWS: Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley) |object   |


# Tools
To explore and analyze the data and do the prediction models in python, we will use Jupyter 
notebook and Python packages, such as: Pandas and NumPy Matplotlib, seaborn and SKLearn for 
modeling. NLTK and Textblob for text pre-processing and cleaning the text Also we will use extra 
libraries for visualization such as Plotly and we may use Flask framework for deployment.
# Algorithms
We will try many experiments in our project using varies machine learning models and a pretrained language model, the pre trained language model consider as feature engineering step and 
we will be using TF-IDF which is statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to 
a document in a collection of documents or corpus. This importance is directly proportional to the 
number of times a word appears in the document. However, the next step of feature engineering 
methods we will use is Count Vectorize which is a feature extraction tool that select the 
words/features/terms which occur the most frequently. In addition, , we will obtain two different 
types of machine learning models:
* Supervised: Multinomial Na√Øve bayes
* Unsupervised: Topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA), Clustering (if needed)
# Conclusion
We aim to know the author who wrote a sentence and discover the difference of written styles for 
the authors by using machine learning algorithms by following the NLP standards and methods. 
To sum up, predicting the true author of sentence will help avoiding crimes such as author identity 
theft
